    <p>4. Background information:</p>
  </body>
  
  <body>
    <p>I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam with my parents and my brother, but when they moved to Moscow, Russia, I was raised there, because their Vietnamese friends were living in Moscow. 
       I didn’t have any education in Moscow, until me and my family went back to Vietnam, but in a different city, which was Ho Chi Minh city in 2004. In this city, I have enrolled in various random English schools to study English language, as well as enrolled in Russian school, in which I studied Russian language, as well as mathematics, English, Russian literature and Arts. 
       After studying in Russian school, I was enrolled in Asia Pacific College School, but I didn’t like it there, since I don’t studied Vietnamese much in Vietnamese classes, because I have poor Vietnamese speaking skills. 
       After that, I enrolled in Australian International School (AIS) in years 8 to 13, skipping year 7, since I have studied English at home with my English tutor. Finally, I have enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam. 
       At first, I choose the engineering programs over IT programs, but after I have realized that the engineering programs were too difficult for me, I have switched to study IT programs, in which I became a Bachelor of IT. 
       My hobby is playing piano when I have free time, because playing video games could waste my time and my energy, in which I could become more tired and want to sleep. 
       In addition, they could fill my mind with video games, in which I will have less concentration when doing homework. I used to play video games, but now I stopped playing, because I have other important things to do and it destroys my restful sleep time.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Interest in IT:</p>
  </body>

  <body>
    <p>My interests in IT is that there are many devices that has unique features, such as smartphone’s touch screen device that allows users to touch any apps by using their fingers, the motion sensors at home could automatically turn on the lights when the person came home, a computers is able to read files when the disk has been inserted into it and internet offers many websites worldwide through wi-fi. My interest in IT starts when I started using computer when I was a child and I could see many websites coming from the internet when I search them on Google and when I click their links in Google. In addition, there are many errors encountered when I opened a file that requires a suitable software to run it smoothly, such as when installing a Python and when inputting a code in PyCharm Community, in which they require updating my laptop’s software through sending my laptop to the computer engineers, so that they could update its software.</p> 
    <body>  
     <p>I chose to come to RMIT, because I wanted to find a job, so that I could raise money for my parents when they get old as I grow up. However, in order to find a job, I should find a program that suits me the most, as I lacked communication skills when choosing marketing programs, as they require me to speak when I show advertisements or presentations. I have chosen IT programs, because I could work silently.
   <body>
     <p>During my studies, I expect to learn how to code properly in various programming languages, because I have poor coding skills, as I focused more on engineering programs than IT programs. In addition, I expect to learn how to work with other students as a team when the teacher gave me a group assignment work, because as I graduate from RMIT, I need to cooperate with my employees to make a better project.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Ideal Job:</p>
  </body>

  <body>
     <p>AI Engineer is a job that involves describing and using the right Artificial Intelligence or cognitive computing technologies in order to fix the problems of the customers’ devices when they are not working and making AI recipes for development of the new technologies, as well as understanding the business problems, contemporary technologies’ challenges and areas of applying AI technologies. In addition, AI Engineer also involves making machine learning models and prototype device applications, AI platforms and AI projects by using made AI recipes. What makes this job appeals to me is that in the past, I have used both computers and phones, but haven’t checked out what are their unique features in them and how they were made, such as smartphone’s touch screen device, laptop’s motion sensor mouse, contemporary devices’ voice commands and search, smartphone’s keyboard that allows users to swipe letters into words through the use of a finger, laptop’s face recognition for automatic log in and contemporary devices’ changeable screen through tilting them into landscape form or into tablet form.
    <body>
       <p>In order to be an AI Engineer, I need to have at least 0.5 years of learning how to use one of Java, C, C++ or Python programming languages, study web application development as well as building API driven interface development. For the programming languages, I need to learn how us C++ for 4 years, Java for 2 years, Swift, C# .NET, SQL, JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The technologies I need to install include API, MVC, RealmSwift, Alamofire, Google Firebase, Java Web, Swing, Tomcat Web Server, JSTL, Struts and Json. In addition, I also need to install Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server, NetBeans, XCode, Postman, Git and Source Tree.</p>
     <body>
        <p>I currently have typing skills, but I have poor coding skills, because I have focused too much on Engineering programs than IT programs when I am studying at RMIT University Vietnam and I study a little bit of IT when I was in AIS School, in which I have little IT skills. I also have mathematical skills, because I have studied mathematics at high school. I got a certificate in AIS School when I have finished Year 13 through successfully competing at least 3 courses. I have successfully completed English, Mathematical Studies and Psychology. I have studied algorithms and strings in Introduction to Programming and made strings and algorithms, but they don’t work properly, as I have poor coding skills, since I was still new to the IT community in RMIT University Vietnam.</p>
    <body>
       <p>I will learn how to code properly and use various programming languages through studying Programming 1 in order to improve my coding skills, as well as learning how to make algorithms and strings in order to make them work properly.</p>

    <p>Personal Profile:</p>
  </body>

  <body>
     <p>The results I got from 16Personalities website, which was a Myers-Briggs test is that my personality type is Defender, in which I have introversion, sensing, feeling, judging, as well as thinking traits (ISFJ-T). This means that I am caring, helpful and organized person, in which I do the things I have planned in an organized way, as well as I am helping other people to fix their mistakes if they have done not right. Not only that, but I am caring to other people as I help them do their work. 
       The results I got from creativity test website is that I have higher complexity, medium abstraction and boldness, low curiosity and perspective and lower persistence and paradox. This means that I have higher capability to carry lots of information, recreate them so that they could make sense even more and manage the relationships between them. Not only that, but I also have the capability to summarize various concepts from their original ideas. 
       The results I got from learning style test website is that I have higher strength of visual learning than auditory and kinesthetic learning. This means that I am good at remembering people’s faces after I have met them, although I sometimes forget their faces, because I haven’t met them again for a long time. In addition, I also could picture the things in my mind, in which when I see the objects and symbols many times, the pictures of them will form in my mind.</p>
     <body>
        <p>These results could influence my behavior in a team, in which I was caring, selfless, organized and helpful person who plans which part each group member could do and when they are finished, they combine the parts together to complete a group work project.</p>
       When doing the group work project, I read instructions carefully, so that I could know what to do and I have a good visual learning, in which I could see visual information clearly and precise, such as charts, graphs and diagrams.</p> 
     <body>
        <p>To take this into account when forming a team, I could ask them which group work project part that my group members could do and once they are finished, me and my group members will merge them together to make a complete group work project. In addition, me and my group members must read the instructions carefully and when seeing visual information, they need to see clearly their details and statistics, so that their information could be stored in our minds for paraphrasing them to be clearer. Not only that, but me and my group members must help each other when facing difficult problems and work together as a group, so that we could overcome these types of problems.</p>

     <p>Project Ideas:</p>
   </body>

   <body>
      <p>The project will be a smartphone app that could check and list all the bugs, glitches and errors that each app would potentially not working properly and fixes and troubleshoots them, so that they could run smoothly and not have any random errors occurring if the user uses the app occasionally if they need it for working purposes. In addition, it also checks the speed and smoothness of the app in order to verify if the apps were slow or fast and if they are slow, they could have errors that need to be fixed.</p> 
    <body>
       <p>This project could be useful in the future and this is the IT innovation I would like to see in the future, because I have encountered many glitches and bugs that have affected my apps, in which they could shut down suddenly or they could be frozen and could not work properly. In addition, they could also be slow, because of the bugs that affected them, such as when writing a reply in RMIT Canvas discussion board and the email apps could leave one red notification circle intact despite the email being read, such as Microsoft Outlook app. It will also help me to develop the skills, experience and knowledge required for me to be qualified as an AI Engineer, because it involves finding and deleting all the bugs, glitches and errors that were found in customers’ apps through using good programming skills and knowledge obtained through studying various programming languages.</p>
     <body>
        <p>This app contains a list of bugs, glitches and errors in a section called “Error list” in which lists out various apps that have any bugs, glitches and errors and lists their description of them when clicking a desired app that has any error. The smartphone user could delete all of them through clicking an option called “Delete all errors”, so that the apps will not be frozen or shut down unexpectedly if the user uses them for various purposes, such as when checking the emails for important meetings in email apps, when searching various topics of interest in search engine apps, when using a scientific calculator app and many more. However, if the app contains lots of bugs, glitches and errors, then it would take a lot of time to remove them entirely. This section also has statuses for each app in order to let the smartphone users know if the app was in critical condition or in fine condition. If it is in critical condition, then this means that the app has lots of bugs, glitches and errors that need to be fixed in order to make the app to run smoothly and not have any unexpected errors. This app also contains a section called “Speed of the Apps” that contains a list of apps’ speeds to know if the app is running slow, normal or fast. If the app is running slow, then the app may contain bugs that slow it from running smoothly and the smartphone user will click their desired app to see what bugs have affected their app’s speed and remove them entirely, so that it could run smoothly. The “Error history” section contains a list of glitches, bugs and errors that have occurred in each apps from last year, last month, last week, yesterday to today, so that the smartphone users could know the day and time they have occurred in their apps in which they could delete them.</p>
      <body>
         <p>Appery.io is a cloud-based app builder that allows the user to create the apps for iOS and Android. PhoneGap is an open source platform that could be used to build cross-platform mobile apps and users could reuse their existed web development skills to make apps that were built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript quicker, but its performance issues may occur, if the user want to have more graphics and images to the app they created.</p>
      <body>
         <p>The skills required for this project is that I need to have good programming, thinking and logical skills in order to create codes that work properly in Appery.io when making this app. In addition, I also need to have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript when building cross-mobile phone apps in PhoneGap, as all mobile phones apps needs to have all of these features in order to be created in various mobile phones, such as Apple, Android and Blackberry. In addition, I also need to learn how to write pseudo codes using paper and pencil before I could put the actual codes to the programming languages, so that they could work properly and smoothly without any problems, as well as designing an app design using paper and pencil in order to implement the options for viewing the list of errors, descriptions of each bugs, glitches and errors that each app have, apps’ speed, apps’ conditions and error history. This app becomes feasible for me to find the skills, software and hardware required, as it allows me to create various apps through coding, programming and using various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, C++ and many more.</p>
      <body>
         <p>If the project is successful, then all the bugs, glitches and errors found in various apps will be gone and they will run smoothly and faster without any unexpected errors occurring by the app’s useful feature to delete all of them at once, in which people will use all apps freely without any problems and slowdowns. This could solve the original problem, in which most of the apps will not work properly, run slowly, freeze or shut down unexpectedly when using them for a certain amount of time, because of the bugs and glitches that have affected them. The impact of this development is that when using this app, all smartphone users will delete all of the errors that have occurred in their devices, so that they will not appear again in order to slow or shut the apps down unexpectedly and people could use all the apps freely and smoothly. However, if this app does not work properly and slowly deleting all the errors, then people could ask me about which updates they want, so that this app will work properly and delete all the errors smoothly and faster.</p>
