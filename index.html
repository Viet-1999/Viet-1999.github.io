       Background information: I am Vietnamese, and I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam with my parents and my brother, but when they moved to Moscow, Russia, I was raised there, because their Vietnamese friends were living in Moscow. 
       I didn’t have any education in Moscow, until me and my family went back to Vietnam, but in a different city, which was Ho Chi Minh city in 2004. In this city, I have enrolled in various random English schools to study English language, as well as enrolled in Russian school, in which I studied Russian language, as well as mathematics, English, Russian literature and Arts. 
       After studying in Russian school, I was enrolled in Asia Pacific College School, but I didn’t like it there, since I don’t studied Vietnamese much in Vietnamese classes, because I have poor Vietnamese speaking skills. 
       After that, I enrolled in Australian International School (AIS) in years 8 to 13, skipping year 7, since I have studied English at home with my English tutor. Finally, I have enrolled at RMIT University Vietnam. 
       At first, I choose the engineering programs over IT programs, but after I have realized that the engineering programs were too difficult for me, I have switched to study IT programs, in which I became a Bachelor of IT. 
       My hobby is playing piano when I have free time, because playing video games could waste my time and my energy, in which I could become more tired and want to sleep. 
       In addition, they could fill my mind with video games, in which I will have less concentration when doing homework. I used to play video games, but now I stopped playing, because I have other important things to do and it destroys my restful sleep time.</p>
